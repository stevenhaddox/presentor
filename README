A simple Sinatra app to clone your Showoff presentations, publish a static version, and provide main index to display them all.

To start:

    $ bundle exec rake boot:strap

This simply invokes the following rake tasks:

    $ bundle exec rake presentations:clone
    $ bundle exec rake presentations:publish
